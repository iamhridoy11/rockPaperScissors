# rockPaperScissors
It's a Rock Paper Scissors game that we can play with the computer.

So the game starts out by asking you to type 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors.

So let's go ahead and type two for scissors, and then it's going to show us a graphic of our choice ex. scissors, and then the choice the computer made, which is ex. rock. 
And of course, rock beats scissors so, user lose.

What this game boils down to is some way of randomly making a choice between rock, paper, or scissors and then comparing that choice that the computer randomly generated against a user choice.

And then based on the rules of rock, paper, and scissors, determining whether if the user won, lost or whether if the game had a draw.
